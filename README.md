# TyperRacer History Plot
This is my attempt at making a python program to plot your race history in TypeRacer to have a clearer picture
## Example plot 1:

## Example plot 2: 
Here I just changed the colorscale attribute of 'trace' from 'Magma' to 'rdylgn'

## UPDATE:
Now you can change the the view mode of the graph to lines, markers and line&markers, a range bar was added to view the progress in a specific part of your journey and now there are a play and a pause button for the animation of your progress in parts of 100 races each.
